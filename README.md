# OpenLLM-Council

![Banner](banner.jpg)

## Mission
The **OpenLLM-Council** is an organization dedicated to advancing the field of multi-agent Large Language Model (LLM) systems. Our mission is to foster collaboration, standardized frameworks, and robust methodologies for creating autonomous agents that can reason, debate, and execute complex tasks with high reliability.

We believe that the future of AI lies not in single, monolithic models, but in the orchestration of specialized agents working together.


## Community & Contributing

We welcome researchers, developers, and enthusiasts to join the council.
